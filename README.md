Notes

I decided to implement this app using microservices architecture instead of using Rails view templates.
The Rails application is for serving a RESTful API that returns JSON,
and the frontend is a React application that communicates with the
Rails API and renders data to the client.

You may visit the following URLs to test:
    - localhost:3000/applicants/1 (GET not currently used, but left for testing)
    - localhost:3000/funnels
